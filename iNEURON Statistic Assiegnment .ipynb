    "Ans:- A correlation coefficient of 0.7 indicates a strong positive relationship between SAT scores and college GPA. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 represents a perfect positive relationship, -1 represents a perfect negative relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, a correlation coefficient of 0.7 suggests that as SAT scores increase, there is a strong tendency for college GPA to also increase. The positive sign indicates that higher SAT scores are generally associated with higher college GPAs.\n",

    "It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. While there is a strong correlation between SAT scores and college GPA, it does not necessarily mean that higher SAT scores cause higher GPAs. Other factors, such as study habits, motivation, and personal qualities, could also influence college performance."

    "Ans:-a. To determine the percentage of individuals with heights between 160 cm and 180 cm, we need to calculate the z-scores for these values and then find the area under the normal distribution curve between those z-scores. \n",
